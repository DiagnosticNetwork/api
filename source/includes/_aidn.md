```csharp
var response = await DNAPI.PartnerSendAsync
(
  HttpMethod.Post,
  "/api/v1/robot",
  new 
  {
    Vin = "JF2SKAWCXKH400000",                     // Optional, but helpful
    Vehicle = "2019 Subaru Forester 2.5L",         // Highly recommended, in case VIN decoding fails
    Classification = "{ClassificationIdentifier}", // we'll coordinate with you on this value
    UserIdentifier = "{UserIdentifier}",           // uniquely identify the customer/employee/user
    Message = "{YourMessageToAiDN}",               // this is typically a user-supplied question
    // `Data` can be an arbitrary piece of data. Typically it is JSON, though we can work with you
    // to accept your specific data formats. It's common to use the `Data` field to pass things 
    // like Symptoms and TroubleCodes (DTCs), as shown below.
    Data = new

  // 429 Too Many Requests, recommend changing the request before retrying).
}
  if ()

    // you can retry your request exactly as you first submitted it. 
    //
    // data["Error"] will be provided here and will explain the underlying problem.
  }
  else
  {
    // If the HTTP status code of the response is 4xx, then there's either a problem
    // with your request (400 Bad Request), and you likely need to fix something before
    // retrying. (The exception is a 429 Too Many Requests error, however in that case
    // ShouldRetry would be `true`.)
    //
    // If the error is a 5xx error, it indicates a server error, which should be 
    // temporary, and you can retry your request (preferably with an exponential back-off).

```json

> When there's an error, it may be like the one shown below, indicating you _should_ retry

> the delay specified in the [`Retry-After`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After) header in our response.

```json
{
  "Error": "Request timed out.",
  "ShouldRetry": true,
  "Message": null,
  "ResponseKey": null
}
```

> When `ShouldRetry` is false, it indicates there is a problem with your request, which should
> be fixed prior to retrying the request. 

```json
